//There are 3 UI based functions in JS that can be used for UI interactions, alert , prompt and confirm
//Alert is like a message box that draws the attention of the user and waits till the user performs or closes that dialogue.
//Prompt is more like a question and answer, where the input is a written value of a function.
//Confirm is more like a confirmation window where a user can accept or reject the information in the form of OK and cancel.
