    <h2>Future Scope</h2>
    <p>In the next ten years, I will focus on becoming a more well-rounded and resilient individual by continuously learning, adapting, and growing. I plan to improve myself by setting clear goals, embracing challenges, and staying committed to personal development. Whether it's enhancing my skills through education and experience, building stronger relationships, or maintaining physical and mental well-being, I will strive to be more disciplined, self-aware, and proactive. I will learn from my mistakes, celebrate my progress, and remain open to feedback, ensuring that each year brings me closer to the best version of myself.</p>
