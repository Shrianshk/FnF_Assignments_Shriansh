    //Method Overriding is a feature that allows a derived class to provide a specific/customized implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. This is useful when the derived class needs to modify or extend the behavior of the base class method.
    // To override a method, the base class method must be marked with the `virtual` keyword, and the derived class method must be marked with the `override` keyword. This allows the derived class to change the implementation of the method while still maintaining the same method signature.
